# FlappyJava Web Server

> *The web server you kind of needed?*

Yes, you need this. We all *(most)* know about IIS, the web server that supports the .NET framework and static files. It has some okay backend access, but not the best. For starters, custom routes are a pain with the URLRewrite module, it's not even built in! However, FlappyJava Server provides a simple built-in route system that **will be expanded** to make routing easier than ever. Without the complicated parts of more interactive web servers, and the annoying parts of IIS, FlappyJava Server provides a better experience.
